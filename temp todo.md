Priority
[ ] Get a working demo with draft-JS instead as it is so much FASTER :)
[ ] Study mode (basic)
[ ] Card tags
[ ] Create repo
[ ] Card import export
[ ] Merge listedcardface and richtexteditor into CardFaceEditor
[ ] Restructure the parser into sections that individually take a file version
[ ] Change ParseError to include a severity. If any severe errors parsing stops. Nonsevere errors are simply logged (or shown to the end user).
[ ] Unit tests for the parser (so that changes for newer version don't screw up parsing of older versions)
[ ] Split all the connected components into containers that don't render anything themselves

Sometime
[ ] License
[ ] Spec for images and occlusions
[ ] Make sure only used parts of the framework are imported
[ ] Change fontawesome from CDN to something better
[ ] Use a proper markdown renderer to prevent XSS
[ ] Make the confirm message show for at least one second to allow the user to read it
[ ] Don't require confirmation for edits where nothing is changed
[ ] Drag and drop reordering of cards (only show ellipsis when reordering)
[ ] Add option for the front and back to appear reversed (like for definitions)
